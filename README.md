# Email_Spammer
 Spam any email inbox with this little python program (Do this only if they are friends)

# Usage
 Just open the program and type in the credentials it asks for and then click the Spam Button and Now you are infinitely spamming the mail address.
 To Stop Spamming close the program
 Note: Only Spamming From Gmail Accounts is supported in this version
       You may also have to Disable some security features in your Account for it to work because Gmail doesn't allow sending emails from 3rd party sources by default.
