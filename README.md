# Email_Spammer
 Spam any email inbox with this little python program (Do this only if they are friends)

# Usage
 Just open the program and type in the credentials it asks for and then click the Spam Button and Now you are infinitely spamming the mail address.<br>
 To Stop Spamming close the program.<br>
 Note: Only Spamming From Gmail Accounts is supported in this version<br>
       You may also have to Disable some security features in your Account for it to work because Gmail doesn't allow sending emails from 3rd party sources by default.
